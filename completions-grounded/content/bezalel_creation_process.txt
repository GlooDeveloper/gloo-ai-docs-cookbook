From Concept to Canvas: The Digital Art Creation Process

The Journey of a Thousand Pixels

Creating a digital painting of a tabernacle artifact at Bezalel Ministries is a journey that typically spans 6-12 weeks for major pieces, involving dozens of hours of artistic labor, constant reference to biblical and historical research, and continuous prayer. Each artwork passes through distinct phases, with multiple reviews and refinements along the way. Understanding this process helps our community appreciate the care and intentionality behind every piece we create.

Phase One: Immersion and Understanding (Week 1)

Before an artist touches their stylus to tablet, they spend significant time immersing themselves in the research. When assigned a new artifact—say, the golden lampstand (menorah)—the artist receives our comprehensive research packet and begins a week-long study process.

Prayer and Devotion: Artists begin each project with dedicated prayer time, asking God for wisdom, accuracy, and inspiration. Many of our artists spend time in relevant Scripture passages devotionally, not just analytically. For the menorah project, an artist might meditate on Zechariah 4, Revelation 1, or Jesus's words "I am the light of the world."

Research Deep Dive: The artist carefully reads through the entire research packet, taking notes on required elements, probable features, and areas of interpretive freedom. They study the biblical texts in multiple translations, examine photographs of archaeological artifacts, and review scholarly reconstructions.

Visual Reference Gathering: Artists compile a reference library of images—photographs of ancient metalwork, studies of light and flame, examples of almond blossom forms (referenced in the menorah's design), and images of oil lamps from the period. They might gather 50-100 reference images for a complex piece.

Conceptual Sketching: The artist creates rough thumbnail sketches exploring different compositions, viewpoints, and lighting scenarios. Should the menorah be shown straight-on or at an angle? Close-up detail or full view showing context? How should light interact with the gold surface? These initial sketches are loose and exploratory, helping the artist visualize possibilities.

Phase Two: Composition and Planning (Week 2)

Once the artist has thoroughly absorbed the research and explored options, they develop a detailed plan for the final piece.

Composition Studies: The artist creates several more refined compositional sketches, typically 3-5 options showing different approaches. These sketches address practical questions: What aspect ratio best serves the subject? Where should the viewer's eye be drawn first? How can the composition communicate both the physical object and its spiritual significance?

Technical Planning: The artist determines the final resolution, color palette, and technical approach. For a piece like the menorah that will be used in both print publications and digital displays, this might mean creating a file at 300 DPI with dimensions suitable for printing at poster size.

Theological Consultation: Before proceeding further, the artist meets with Dr. Thornwell or another member of our theological team to discuss the composition. They explore questions like: Does this viewpoint emphasize the biblical details we want to highlight? Are there symbolic or theological elements we should incorporate? How can lighting suggest the divine presence associated with the menorah?

Approval: The artist submits their compositional studies to their senior artist mentor and our creative director for feedback. Once a composition is approved, they proceed to the next phase with confidence.

Phase Three: Foundational Digital Work (Weeks 3-4)

With composition approved, the artist begins the actual digital painting process. At Bezalel, most artists work in software like Adobe Photoshop or Procreate on professional-grade tablets.

Detailed Line Drawing: The artist creates a precise line drawing at full resolution, working from the biblical measurements and their compositional study. This drawing serves as the skeleton for all subsequent work. For objects with geometric precision like the ark of the covenant, artists sometimes use 3D modeling software to ensure accurate perspective before painting over the rendered model.

Value Study: Before adding color, artists create a grayscale value study establishing the full range from deepest shadows to brightest highlights. This crucial step ensures the piece will have proper depth and dimensional form. Many beginning artists want to jump straight to color, but our senior artists have learned that a strong value foundation is essential.

Material Blocking: The artist blocks in basic colors for different materials—the warm yellow of gold, the darker tones of acacia wood, the richness of blue and purple fabrics. This stage is still rough, establishing color relationships without detail.

Lighting Foundation: The artist establishes the primary light source and begins building the basic lighting structure. For artifacts associated with God's presence, lighting is particularly significant—these pieces often feature a warm, divine light that suggests God's glory.

Phase Four: Refinement and Detail (Weeks 5-8)

This is the longest and most labor-intensive phase, where the piece transforms from a rough study into a refined artwork.

Surface Texture Development: The artist works section by section, developing realistic textures. Gold surfaces receive careful attention to achieve the characteristic warm luster, subtle imperfections from hammer marks, and complex reflections. Fabric receives texture suggesting the weave pattern. Wood shows grain and natural variation.

Detail Rendering: Elements like the hammered flower forms on the menorah, the cherubim on the mercy seat, or the precious stones in the high priest's breastplate receive meticulous attention. Artists work at high magnification, often spending hours on elements that occupy just a small portion of the final image.

Light and Atmosphere: The artist refines lighting, adding subtle reflected light, ambient occlusion in crevices, and the complex ways light interacts with different materials. For interior tabernacle scenes, they depict the quality of light filtered through fabric walls—different from outdoor lighting.

Theological Elements: If the piece includes symbolic or theological layers beyond pure historical reconstruction, these are carefully integrated. This might mean the way light breaks through darkness, a composition that subtly echoes the cross, or symbolic colors that reference New Testament fulfillment.

Multiple Review Points: Throughout this phase, the artist submits work-in-progress images to their mentor for feedback every few days. This iterative review process helps catch issues early and ensures the piece stays on track.

Phase Five: Research Verification (Week 9)

When the artist considers the piece essentially complete, it enters a formal review process for accuracy.

Self-Review: The artist carefully reviews their work against the research packet, checking that all required elements are present and accurate. Did the menorah receive seven branches, not nine? Are the cherubim's wings positioned according to the biblical description? Are the measurements proportionally correct?

Research Team Review: Our research team examines the piece carefully, comparing every detail against biblical specifications and historical evidence. They provide written feedback noting any concerns or corrections needed.

Theological Review: Dr. Thornwell or another theological advisor reviews the piece for theological accuracy and appropriateness, particularly examining any symbolic or typological elements.

Technical Review: The creative director reviews the piece for technical quality—proper resolution, color accuracy, file format specifications, and overall artistic excellence.

Phase Six: Revision and Finalization (Weeks 10-11)

Based on feedback from the review process, the artist makes necessary revisions. Sometimes these are minor adjustments—slightly modifying a color, adding a small detail. Occasionally, more significant changes are needed. We've had instances where review revealed that an artist had inadvertently depicted an element inconsistently with Scripture, requiring substantial rework.

The artist addresses each piece of feedback systematically, submitting revised versions until all reviewers approve. No piece is finalized until it has unanimous approval from our artistic, research, and theological teams.

Phase Seven: Preparation for Publication (Week 12)

Once the artwork itself is approved, the artist prepares various versions for different uses:

Master Archive File: The highest resolution version with all layers intact, archived for future use or revision.

Print-Ready Files: High-resolution flattened files in appropriate color spaces (usually CMYK) for print publication, exported in multiple sizes for different print applications.

Digital Display Files: RGB files optimized for screen display, in various sizes for website use, social media, and digital study materials.

Detail Crops: For complex pieces, artists create detail crops highlighting specific elements—useful for study materials that want to focus on particular features.

Metadata and Documentation: Each file receives proper metadata including title, artist name, creation date, and copyright information. The artist also compiles documentation noting any areas of interpretive decision-making.

Technical Standards and Tools

Bezalel maintains rigorous technical standards to ensure consistency and quality across all our artwork:

Resolution: Minimum 300 DPI for print applications; master files often created at 600 DPI for maximum flexibility

Color Management: Careful calibration of monitors and use of standard color spaces to ensure accurate color reproduction

File Formats: Master files in PSD or PROCREATE format with layers; final deliverables in TIFF, PNG, and JPG as appropriate

Backup Protocols: Artists save incremental versions throughout the process; all files backed up to our secure cloud storage daily

Software and Hardware: While artists have some flexibility in their tools, most use Adobe Creative Suite or Procreate on iPad Pro. The ministry provides technology stipends to ensure all artists have professional-grade equipment.

The Spiritual Dimension

Throughout this technical process runs a spiritual current that distinguishes Bezalel's work from purely commercial digital art. Artists report that creating these pieces is often a profound spiritual experience:

Prayer and Worship: Many artists pray throughout the creative process, particularly when working on elements most directly associated with God's presence—the mercy seat, the holy of holies, the divine light.

Spiritual Warfare: Several artists have noted experiencing unusual spiritual resistance or attack when working on pieces depicting sacred objects or priestly mediation. We take this seriously and support our artists with prayer covering.

Revelation and Insight: Artists frequently report experiencing fresh insights into Scripture while working. The intense focus on details of the tabernacle often illuminates theological truths in new ways.

Worship Through Work: Perhaps most commonly, artists describe the work itself as an act of worship—using their gifts to glorify God and serve the church, just as Bezalel did in creating the original tabernacle furnishings.

Quality Over Speed

While we've outlined a typical 12-week timeline, some pieces take much longer. Our depiction of the ark of the covenant took nearly six months, with extensive research into the cherubim's appearance and theological consultation about how to depict God's presence above the mercy seat without attempting to depict God Himself—a careful theological and artistic balance.

We never rush pieces to meet arbitrary deadlines. Quality and accuracy are always prioritized over speed. We'd rather delay a release than compromise on excellence.

Ongoing Improvement

Even after publication, we remain open to feedback and willing to revise our work. Several times we've updated pieces based on new archaeological evidence or scholarly insights brought to our attention. We maintain version numbers for each piece and clearly communicate when updated versions are released.

The Ultimate Goal

Every phase of this process, every hour of work, every pixel carefully placed, serves one ultimate goal: helping believers encounter the beauty and truth of God's redemptive plan as revealed through the tabernacle and fulfilled in Christ. When a pastor uses our image of the bronze altar to teach about Christ's sacrifice, when a small group studies our depiction of the high priest's garments to understand Jesus's intercessory work, when an individual believer contemplates our rendering of the veil and marvels at the access we now have to God's presence—then all the painstaking labor is worthwhile.

We create not for art's sake alone, nor for historical interest alone, but for the glory of God and the building up of His church. Every piece is an offering, a digital representation of ancient sacred objects, crafted with the same spirit that led Bezalel to pour his skill into gold and acacia wood thousands of years ago.

To God be the glory, in all our digital brushstrokes and every carefully rendered reflection of light on gold.

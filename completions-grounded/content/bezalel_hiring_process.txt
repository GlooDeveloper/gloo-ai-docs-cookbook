The Artist Selection Process at Bezalel Ministries

A Calling Within a Calling

At Bezalel Ministries, we believe that creating digital representations of the tabernacle's sacred artifacts is not merely a job—it is a calling. Just as God specifically chose and equipped Bezalel and Oholiab for the work of the tabernacle (Exodus 35:30-35), we seek artists whom God has gifted and called to this unique ministry. Our hiring process reflects this conviction, combining rigorous assessment of artistic skill with careful discernment of spiritual readiness.

The Three-Phase Selection Journey

Phase One: Application and Portfolio Review

Artists who feel called to join Bezalel Ministries begin by submitting a comprehensive application that includes three key components. First, they provide a detailed portfolio demonstrating mastery of digital painting techniques, with particular attention to realistic rendering of metallic surfaces, fabric textures, and lighting effects—all essential for depicting tabernacle artifacts. We look for artists who can work in multiple styles, from photorealistic to slightly stylized, as different projects require different approaches.

Second, applicants submit a statement of faith and calling. We require that all artists be committed followers of Jesus Christ with a clear testimony of their relationship with Him. We ask them to articulate their understanding of the tabernacle's significance and how they see their artistic gifts serving the church. We're particularly interested in artists who view their work as worship and ministry, not merely employment.

Third, candidates must provide references from their pastor or ministry leader who can speak to their character, spiritual maturity, and involvement in their local church. We've found that artists who are not actively serving and connected in a local body of believers often struggle with the unique spiritual dynamics of this work.

Our artistic review committee, composed of three senior artists and our creative director, evaluates each portfolio against established criteria: technical excellence, attention to detail, ability to work with biblical and historical source material, and capacity for symbolic and metaphorical visual communication. Approximately 30 percent of applicants advance past this initial phase.

Phase Two: The Test Commission

Artists who pass the initial review are invited to complete a test commission—a paid project that allows both parties to assess fit. We assign one of three standard test pieces: a detailed rendering of the bronze laver, a study of the high priest's ephod, or a close-up of the mercy seat with the cherubim.

This phase typically takes 4-6 weeks and serves multiple purposes. It allows us to observe how the artist interprets biblical descriptions, incorporates research materials, responds to feedback, and manages deadlines. We provide each artist with our standard research packet—compiled by our biblical studies team—containing relevant Scripture passages, scholarly articles on tabernacle construction, and archaeological findings.

Equally important, this phase allows the artist to experience the spiritual nature of the work. Many artists report that creating these pieces is different from other commissions—that they find themselves in prayer, wrestling with theological concepts, and experiencing both spiritual warfare and breakthrough. We've learned that not every talented artist is prepared for this dimension of the work.

Our senior artist mentors work closely with each candidate during this phase, providing both technical and spiritual guidance. We look for artists who are teachable, who can incorporate feedback gracefully, and who demonstrate a heart for accuracy and excellence. We also observe whether they're proactive in their research, asking good questions and thinking theologically about their artistic choices.

About 60 percent of artists who complete a test commission are invited to continue to phase three.

Phase Three: Apprenticeship and Integration

Artists who successfully complete their test commission enter a six-month apprenticeship period. During this time, they work on two to three smaller projects while participating in our comprehensive training program.

The apprenticeship includes three key components:

Biblical and Theological Training: All artists complete our 12-week online course "The Tabernacle and Christ," taught by our resident biblical scholar, Dr. Marcus Thornwell. This course covers the historical, cultural, and theological significance of each tabernacle element, with particular emphasis on typology and how these objects point to Christ. Artists are expected to engage deeply with the material, as this knowledge directly impacts their creative work.

Technical Workshops: Senior artists lead monthly workshops on specific techniques relevant to our work—rendering gold and bronze, creating realistic fabric textures, depicting divine light, and working with symbolic color palettes. These workshops also cover our technical specifications, file management systems, and collaborative workflows.

Spiritual Formation: Perhaps most unique to our process, each apprentice is paired with a mentor—not for artistic development, but for spiritual formation. Our mentors are mature believers (some artists, some not) who meet monthly with apprentices to pray, discuss the spiritual challenges of the work, and provide pastoral care. Creating sacred art can be spiritually intense, and we want to ensure our artists are supported.

During apprenticeship, we look for artists who demonstrate growth not just in skill but in their theological understanding and spiritual maturity. We observe how they handle creative challenges, whether they maintain the quality and prayerful approach when deadlines are tight, and how they collaborate with other team members.

At the end of six months, the apprentice's work is reviewed by our full artistic team and our board of directors. Successful apprentices are offered a position as a full Bezalel artist.

Ongoing Development and Community

Becoming a full Bezalel artist is not the end of development but the beginning of a long-term journey. We invest heavily in our artists' continued growth through:

- Annual retreats combining artistic development, theological training, and spiritual renewal
- Sabbatical opportunities every four years for senior artists to rest, study, and explore new techniques
- Continuing education stipends for courses in theology, biblical languages, archaeology, or advanced artistic techniques
- Monthly "Artist Prayer Gatherings" where our distributed team connects via video for worship, prayer, and encouragement

What We Look For: The Bezalel Profile

While every artist brings unique gifts, we've identified common characteristics among our most successful team members:

Technical Excellence: Mastery of digital painting tools and techniques, with particular strength in realistic rendering, attention to historical accuracy, and ability to work from textual descriptions and archaeological evidence.

Theological Curiosity: A genuine desire to understand Scripture deeply, willingness to study and learn, and ability to translate theological concepts into visual form.

Humble Confidence: The paradoxical combination of confidence in one's artistic abilities with humility to receive feedback, make revisions, and submit one's work to biblical and historical accuracy.

Worshipful Attitude: An approach to art-making as an act of worship, with recognition that these pieces will be used to teach and inspire believers worldwide.

Community Orientation: While much of the work is solitary, our artists must be able to collaborate, encourage teammates, and contribute to our ministry culture.

Spiritual Resilience: The capacity to persevere through spiritual challenges, maintain prayer and Scripture reading practices, and draw strength from Christian community.

Diversity and Inclusion

Bezalel Ministries actively seeks artists from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and artistic traditions. We believe the global church is enriched by diverse perspectives, and we want our artwork to reflect the breadth of Christ's kingdom. We currently have artists from six continents, working in contexts ranging from urban studios to rural villages, and we provide technology support to ensure all artists have the tools they need regardless of their economic situation.

An Invitation

If you're a digital artist who loves Jesus, has a heart for the church, and feels drawn to this unique calling, we invite you to explore whether Bezalel Ministries might be your place of service. Our application portal opens quarterly, and you can find current opportunities and application materials at our website.

We're looking for more than employees—we're seeking fellow worshipers who will use their gifts to help the church encounter the beauty of God's redemptive plan as revealed in the tabernacle's shadows and ultimately fulfilled in Christ.

May the Lord guide your steps as you discern His calling on your artistic gifts.

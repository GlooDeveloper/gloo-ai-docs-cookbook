Equipping the Church: Educational Partnerships and Resources

Beyond Beautiful Images

While Bezalel Ministries is known for our digital artwork depicting tabernacle artifacts, we've always understood that beautiful images alone are insufficient for our mission. From our founding, we've been committed to providing comprehensive educational resources that help pastors, teachers, and individual believers understand the profound theological significance of these ancient objects and their fulfillment in Christ.

What began as simple study notes accompanying our artwork has grown into a multi-faceted educational ministry serving hundreds of churches, Bible colleges, and seminaries worldwide. Our resources combine biblical scholarship, theological depth, historical context, and practical teaching tools—all designed to make the tabernacle accessible and meaningful for contemporary believers.

The Bezalel Study Guide Series

Each major artwork we produce is accompanied by a comprehensive study guide, typically 15-25 pages in length. These guides are the fruit of collaboration between our research team, theologians, and experienced Bible teachers who understand how to translate scholarly insights into accessible teaching.

Biblical Foundation: Every study guide begins with careful examination of the relevant biblical texts. We walk through the passages in Exodus describing the artifact's construction, explore other scriptural references to the object, and help readers understand the Hebrew terminology and cultural context.

Historical and Archaeological Context: We provide accessible summaries of what archaeology and ancient Near Eastern studies reveal about materials, construction techniques, and the cultural world in which the tabernacle was built. This helps modern readers bridge the gap between ancient Israel and contemporary understanding.

Symbolic and Theological Significance: This is often the longest and most important section. We explore what each artifact meant in its original context—its role in Israel's worship, its theological symbolism, and its significance in the unfolding biblical narrative. We examine how the object points forward to Christ, drawing particularly on the book of Hebrews' interpretation of the tabernacle.

Discussion Questions: Each guide includes 8-12 thoughtful discussion questions suitable for small groups, Sunday school classes, or personal reflection. These questions move from observation to interpretation to application, helping learners engage deeply with the material.

Teaching Applications: We provide practical suggestions for how the material might be used in different teaching contexts—sermon illustrations, small group studies, children's lessons, or personal devotions.

Further Resources: Each guide concludes with recommended resources for those wanting to study further—commentaries, scholarly articles, and relevant books (we partner with publishers to offer discounts on recommended titles).

Our study guides are available as free downloads in PDF format, and we've had them professionally translated into twelve languages with more in progress. To date, our study guides have been downloaded over 300,000 times from our website.

Curriculum Partnerships

We've developed formal partnerships with several organizations to create comprehensive curriculum materials:

The Tabernacle and Christ: A 12-Week Study: Developed in partnership with Small Group Network, this curriculum takes groups through a systematic study of the tabernacle, using our artwork and original teaching videos. Each week focuses on a different aspect of the tabernacle—the courtyard, the bronze altar, the laver, the holy place, the menorah, the table of showbread, the altar of incense, and finally the holy of holies with the ark. The curriculum has been used by over 500 churches and has received consistently positive feedback for its theological depth and practical accessibility.

From Shadows to Substance: A Family Devotional Series: Created with Youthworks, this 8-week family devotional makes the tabernacle accessible for families with children ages 6-12. Each week includes age-appropriate teaching, interactive activities (building models, object lessons, crafts), memory verses, and family discussion questions. Parents report that the visual nature of our artwork combined with hands-on activities helps children grasp theological concepts they might otherwise miss.

Hebrews in High Definition: Seminary Course Materials: We've partnered with three evangelical seminaries to provide visual resources and teaching materials for courses on the book of Hebrews. Students studying Hebrews 8-10 can examine high-resolution images of the very objects the biblical author describes, gaining visual literacy in the tabernacle's layout and function. Several professors have told us this significantly enhances student understanding and engagement.

The Christological Connections: Preaching Workshop: Developed with The Gospel Coalition, this resource helps preachers understand and communicate the connections between Old Testament tabernacle imagery and New Testament Christology. It includes our artwork, exegetical notes, sermon outlines, and video teaching from respected Bible teachers.

Digital Resource Library

Our website houses an extensive digital resource library, all freely accessible:

High-Resolution Image Downloads: Churches and teachers can download high-resolution versions of our artwork for use in sermons, teaching materials, and publications (with proper attribution). We provide images in multiple formats and sizes, including PowerPoint-optimized versions and print-ready files.

Video Resources: Our growing library includes short teaching videos (3-5 minutes) on each major artifact, virtual tours through the tabernacle's layout, and interviews with scholars discussing tabernacle theology. These videos feature our artwork brought to life through subtle animation and narration.

Interactive Tabernacle Model: Our newest resource is an interactive 3D model of the entire tabernacle complex. Users can virtually walk through the courtyard, enter the holy place, and study each artifact in detail. The model includes hotspots with information and biblical references, making it a powerful tool for visual learners.

Blog and Articles: We regularly publish articles exploring aspects of tabernacle theology, historical background, and practical teaching applications. Our most popular series, "Typology Tuesdays," explores different ways the tabernacle points to Christ.

Podcast Series: "Meeting God in the Wilderness": This 24-episode podcast series walks through the tabernacle systematically, combining biblical teaching, scholarly insights, and practical application. Episodes average 25-30 minutes and are designed for individual listening or group study.

Seminary and Bible College Partnerships

We maintain formal partnerships with sixteen seminaries and Bible colleges worldwide, providing them with:

Free Access to Our Complete Library: Partner institutions receive unlimited access to all our resources for use in their courses and libraries.

Guest Lectures and Workshops: Our team members (including Dr. Thornwell and senior artists) provide guest lectures, workshops, and chapel messages at partner institutions, typically 2-3 visits per year per institution.

Student Internship Opportunities: Select students from partner institutions can apply for summer internships at Bezalel, gaining hands-on experience in biblical research, digital art production, or educational resource development.

Collaborative Research Projects: We occasionally collaborate with faculty members on research projects related to tabernacle studies, biblical theology, or the intersection of art and theology.

These partnerships have enriched our work immeasurably—theological educators push us toward greater precision and depth, while we provide visual and educational resources that enhance their teaching.

Church Partnership Program

Any church can become a formal Bezalel partner at no cost. Partner churches receive:

Priority Access to New Releases: Partner churches get early access to new artwork and resources, typically 2-4 weeks before public release.

Customized Teaching Packages: We help churches plan sermon series or teaching emphases around tabernacle themes, providing customized resource packages.

Technical Support: We assist churches with technical questions about using our images in presentations or publications.

Prayer Partnership: We commit to pray regularly for our partner churches and ask them to pray for our work.

In return, we simply ask partner churches to:
- Provide proper attribution when using our materials
- Share feedback on how our resources are being used and how they might be improved
- Consider financial support if able (though this is never required)

Over 300 churches worldwide are currently Bezalel partners, ranging from small rural congregations to urban megachurches, representing dozens of denominations and traditions.

Missions and Translation Initiative

One of our most ambitious projects is making our resources accessible to the global church through translation and cultural adaptation.

Translation Projects: We've completed translations of our core study guides into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Swahili, Arabic, Russian, Indonesian, Hindi, Tagalog, and Amharic. Each translation is done by qualified translators who are also committed believers, ensuring both linguistic accuracy and theological faithfulness.

Cultural Adaptation: We recognize that some illustrations or applications in our materials reflect Western cultural assumptions. When translating materials for non-Western contexts, we work with local partners to adapt examples and applications appropriately while maintaining theological content.

Missionary Partnerships: We partner with missionaries and mission organizations to get our resources into the hands of church planters, Bible translators, and indigenous Christian leaders worldwide. Several missionary organizations use our materials in their training programs.

Subsidized Access: For churches and institutions in economically challenged regions, we provide free printed materials (study guides, posters) shipped at our expense. This program is funded by donations from churches in more affluent areas.

Conferences and Training Events

We host and participate in various conferences and training events:

Annual Bezalel Conference: Each year we host a two-day conference featuring teaching on tabernacle theology, workshops on using visual resources in teaching, and opportunities for fellowship and prayer. The conference draws 200-300 pastors, teachers, and ministry leaders.

Regional Training Workshops: We conduct one-day workshops in various cities, training church leaders to use our resources effectively. These workshops combine biblical teaching, practical training, and Q&A sessions.

Conference Participation: Our team members regularly present at conferences focused on biblical theology, preaching, Christian education, and worship. We've presented at The Gospel Coalition National Conference, Worship God Conference, ETS Annual Meeting, and many regional events.

Webinars and Online Training: For those unable to attend in-person events, we offer quarterly webinars on topics like "Teaching Typology to Your Congregation," "Visual Literacy in Biblical Education," and "Making Leviticus Come Alive."

Special Populations Resources

We've developed specialized resources for specific ministry contexts:

Children's Ministry: Beyond our family devotional, we offer Sunday school curriculum, activity sheets, and age-appropriate artwork for children's spaces. Our simplified artwork maintains theological accuracy while being visually accessible to young children.

Youth Ministry: Resources designed for teenagers include discussion guides on topics like sacrifice, access to God, and priestly mediation—themes that resonate with common teenage questions about faith.

Prison Ministry: We provide study materials formatted for prison correspondence courses, and our artwork is used in several prison chapels. The themes of substitutionary sacrifice and access to God through Christ resonate powerfully in prison contexts.

Senior Adult Ministry: Resources with larger print, simplified layouts, and discussion questions suited for older adults who may have different life experiences and learning preferences.

Disability-Accessible Resources: We're developing audio descriptions of our artwork for visually impaired users, and simplified study guides for those with cognitive disabilities.

Measuring Impact

How do we know if our educational resources are effective? We track several metrics:

Quantitative Measures: Downloads, website traffic, curriculum sales, number of partner churches and institutions, translation completion rates, and conference attendance.

Qualitative Feedback: We regularly survey users about how they've used our resources and what impact they've seen. Testimonials from pastors about changed teaching, from small group leaders about enriched discussions, and from individual believers about deeper understanding encourage us and help us improve.

Theological Assessment: Our board of theological advisors periodically reviews our educational content to ensure ongoing theological accuracy and biblical faithfulness.

Perhaps most meaningful are the stories we receive—the pastor who reports that teaching through the tabernacle transformed his congregation's understanding of Christ's work, the missionary who used our materials to help a house church grasp the significance of Jesus as our great high priest, the teenager who wrote to say that studying the tabernacle helped her understand why Jesus had to die, the seminary student who changed his dissertation topic after encountering our resources.

Looking Forward

Our educational ministry continues to expand. Current projects in development include:

- A comprehensive video course on tabernacle theology suitable for adult Sunday school or small groups
- Augmented reality experiences that let users "place" virtual tabernacle artifacts in their physical space
- An advanced course for pastors and teachers on preaching Christ from tabernacle texts
- Children's storybook series bringing tabernacle narratives to life
- Expanded accessibility resources for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities

We're also exploring partnerships with Christian publishers to create print books featuring our artwork and teaching—making our resources available through traditional publishing channels.

The Heart of Our Educational Mission

At the core of all our educational work is a simple conviction: the tabernacle matters because Christ matters. These ancient objects, described in such detail in Scripture, were not arbitrary religious artifacts but God-designed symbols pointing forward to the Messiah.

When believers understand what the bronze altar represented, they grasp more fully what happened at Calvary. When they comprehend the high priest's role and garments, they better appreciate Jesus's intercessory ministry. When they recognize what the veil's tearing meant, they marvel more deeply at their access to God's presence.

Our educational resources exist to build these bridges of understanding—helping contemporary believers connect ancient shadows with the eternal substance found in Jesus Christ. Every study guide, every curriculum, every training workshop is ultimately about magnifying Christ and building up His church.

We're honored to serve the global body of Christ in this way, equipping teachers and learners with resources that illuminate Scripture's testimony to Jesus. To Him who is the reality to which all the shadows pointed, be glory forever and ever.
